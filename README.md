## Lakeside Blues Theme for Github Pages by TR-Systems

Click here for all you need to know, [Lakeside Blues](https://tr-systems.github.io/lakeside/), then grab it and go!

My plan is to use this repo for development and testing of new features for my [TR-Systems site](https://tr-systems.github.io/lakeside/), as my time and interest dictates. For me, this is all just for grins and giggles folks, perfect retirement hobby for me while in the deep freeze of the great white north.

Yah hey, ya hosers! Rock on!
