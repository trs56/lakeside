### Under Perpetual Development - Last Updated: 3/22/24
I have been using this as a learning tool for developing and testing changes for my [TR-Systems site](https://tr-systems.github.io/web/){:target="_blank"} and will continue to do so as my time, other projects, interests and the seasons dictate. So this could be it for a while. It's now got everything I wanted for starters, along with some very helpful information for newbies like me who might like to get started themselves.

To do so, click here to [Get Started Today!](getstarted.md)

This design started out by copying the GitHub Pages Modernist Theme, which [looks like this](https://pages-themes.github.io/modernist/){:target="_blank"}.

### Usage
Good for system documentation and other articles of interest, keeping it simple with clean modern design. Especially good for large documents that would benefit from an *always present* table of contents for easy navigation.
